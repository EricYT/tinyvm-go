# Note that the problem has been extended to find all multiples under 1 million.
# This is to make the execution time more significant and measurable.

# Specify a label named "start," and it will become the entrypoint for the program.

	xor edx, edx
	
	mov eax, 3
loop0:	add edx, eax
	add eax, 3
	cmp eax, ebx
	jl loop0

# A line prepended with a pound sign is commented out

	mov eax, 5

	add eax, 15
	cmp eax, ebx
	jl loop1

	mov eax, 10
loop2:	add edx, eax
	add eax, 15
	cmp eax, ebx
